# Vector SIL Kit Adapter for GPIOs
This collection of software is provided to illustrate how the [Vector SIL Kit](https://github.com/vectorgrp/sil-kit/)
can be attached to a GPIO device.

This repository contains instructions to build the adapter and set up a minimal working development environment.

The main contents are working examples of necessary software to connect the running system to a SIL Kit environment,
as well as complimentary demo applications for some communication to happen.

Those instructions assume you use a Linux OS (or a virtual machine running a Linux image) for building and running the adapter and use ``bash`` as your interactive
shell.
